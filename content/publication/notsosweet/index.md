abstract: "Issue: There have been multiple reports of Americans who cannot afford insulin products.
Goal: To describe insulin use patterns, out-of-pocket costs, and financial burdens for American adults under age 65 with diabetes over time.
Methods: Analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and National Health Interview Survey.
Key Findings: Uninsured Americans with diabetes are much more likely to be using less costly (and less effective) formulations of insulin compared to peers with private insurance or Medicaid. Uninsured people are also much more likely to pay full list price for insulin (68%) than the privately insured (9%) or Medicaid beneficiaries (3%). The uninsured spend more out of pocket on all prescriptions ( 2,456)thantheprivatelyinsured( 1,274) and are more likely to report being unable to afford prescription medicines (38% versus 10%). However, among the privately insured, insulin accounts for a significant portion of total out-of-pocket expenses.
Conclusions: Among those under age 65, increasing access to insurance coverage and the generosity of that coverage are the most important steps for increasing access to insulin. In particular, continued expansion of Medicaid and limiting overall out-of-pocket spending for those with private insurance will protect people with diabetes from high costs."
